# rbylua
Lua scripts for shiny hunting in RBY games.

Work only with vba rr 23.6.

Do not use lua scripts inside the dev folder, since they're not ready yet.
# How to use
Choose the appropriate region of your ROM. If you're unsure about it, run version_check first.
## Gift ##
Valid also for starters. DVs are generated after prompted to nickname your Pok√©mon.

Put the cursor over "no" (nicknames not yet supported) and run the script
## Stationary ##
There are five stationaries: Snorlax, the three birds and Mewtwo.

Interact with the sprite, stop at the cry text before the battle and run the script.
